# usb_to_serial

The idea this project is only make a simply usb to serial converter, 
but can be uses for newbies for have a begin with STM32CUBE, 
how to configure a usb descriptor, USART, etc.


I want in the future grow up with this project and add usb-to-i2c, 
usb-to-spi, usb-to-can, for this I accept suggestions and collaborations.

In this case I'm using STM32f0-discovery (https://br.mouser.com/datasheet/2/389/32f072bdiscovery-953661.pdf).
